# Pixel to VH/VW Converter
This tool will allow you to easily convert values from Pixel units to VH/VW units and viceversa.


## What makes this tool different?

> What makes this tool a bit different is that you don't need to go and find your window viewport size everytime you want to convert an element cause javascript does that for you.

### How to use the tool ?? 

> Let's say you want to make your element responsive. One of the things you would do is to changes the pixels to a vw or vh units. Assuming the element is 150px. Then you would open the tool and resize the window accordingly and then type the pixels ratio.

> The element that I want to make responsive is the two selection box. u

> The element that I want to convert has 150px
